# AgentCore CDK Project

Deploy in `us-east-2` using AWS profile `gtmsos` (`AWS_REGION=us-east-2`, `AWS_PROFILE=gtmsos`). In PowerShell, set `$env:AWS_REGION="us-east-2"` and `$env:AWS_PROFILE="gtmsos"` before deployment.

This CDK project is managed by the AgentCore CLI. It deploys your agent infrastructure into AWS using the `@aws/agentcore-cdk` L3 constructs.

## Structure

- `bin/cdk.ts` — Entry point. Reads project configuration from `agentcore/` and creates a stack per deployment target.
- `lib/cdk-stack.ts` — Defines `AgentCoreStack`, which wraps the `AgentCoreApplication` L3 construct.
- `test/cdk.test.ts` — Unit tests for stack synthesis.

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm run test` run unit tests
- `npx cdk synth` emit the synthesized CloudFormation template
- `npx cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `npx cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state

## Usage

You typically don't need to interact with this directory directly. The AgentCore CLI handles synthesis and deployment:

```bash
agentcore deploy    # synthesizes and deploys via CDK
agentcore status    # checks deployment status
```
